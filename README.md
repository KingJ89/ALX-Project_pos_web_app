Challenges
Technical Challenges Discovered

    API Integration and Communication
    Initially, I planned for seamless integration with external APIs for payment processing, tax calculation, and currency conversion. However, during the integration process, I realized that each API has different rate limits, response structures, and authentication mechanisms, which required more complex error handling and retry logic than anticipated.

    Adaptation: To address this, I introduced an abstraction layer between the API calls and the backend logic to handle communication inconsistencies. This layer retries failed API requests with exponential backoff and logs any issues for manual inspection.

    Database Optimization
    While designing the database schema, I initially assumed the transaction volume and inventory queries would be manageable with standard SQL queries. However, as I simulated higher transaction volumes, performance bottlenecks arose, especially during complex queries that join multiple tables.

    Adaptation: To resolve this, I had to optimize the database by adding indexes to key columns (such as item_id, sale_id, and user_id) and refining my SQL queries. I also decided to implement database caching for frequently accessed data like inventory counts to reduce query load.

    Frontend and Backend Synchronization
    While developing the frontend and backend independently, I noticed synchronization issues when communicating data between the frontend JavaScript code and the backend Python/Flask API. Sometimes, asynchronous actions in JavaScript, like sales processing, would complete before the backend had processed the request fully.

    Adaptation: To solve this, I improved the use of promises and asynchronous handling on the frontend. I also added loading indicators to improve user experience and ensure that actions were completed before moving forward in the workflow.

Non-Technical Challenges

    Scope Creep During the development process, additional features that weren't part of the initial MVP started to seem appealing, such as multi-currency support and analytics dashboards. These additional features could have delayed the MVP release significantly.

    Adaptation: I had to continually revisit the original project plan and remind myself of the MVP's goal. By sticking to the core features, I avoided unnecessary feature additions that could slow down progress.

    Time Management Balancing the different components of the project, especially frontend and backend development, took more time than I initially anticipated. Estimating the exact time for different phases of the project turned out to be challenging.

    Adaptation: I began using a more rigid project management schedule with tools like Trello, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. This allowed me to track my progress more effectively and set more realistic deadlines for specific milestones.

    Communication with External Helpers Since I work with some external help, there were challenges in communicating clear project requirements, particularly with non-technical collaborators. Misunderstandings about the scope and features of the project led to delays and rework.

    Adaptation: To minimize these challenges, I introduced clearer documentation and mockups for each feature. Regular check-ins were also crucial to ensure that everyone was on the same page regarding the project's current state and upcoming tasks.

    Knowledge Sharing
        Community Support: I leveraged online communities and forums to troubleshoot issues I encountered during development. The collective knowledge of these communities helped me solve problems more quickly and learn new techniques that I could apply to the project.
        Documentation Assistance: I sought help in creating thorough documentation, which was especially beneficial when defining API endpoints and methods. This collaboration ensured that the documentation was clear, concise, and helpful for anyone else who might work on the project in the future.

Help Provided

    Peer Support
        Troubleshooting Assistance: I provided help to peers who were facing issues with similar projects, particularly with setting up their Flask environments and configuring databases. This not only reinforced my own understanding but also fostered a sense of community.
        Knowledge Sharing: I shared resources and tutorials that I found useful, helping others avoid the same challenges I faced. This exchange of information has been mutually beneficial.

    Collaborative Brainstorming
        Feature Discussions: I engaged in brainstorming sessions with peers to discuss potential features and functionalities for the project. These sessions sparked new ideas and led to better decision-making about what to include in the MVP.
        Design Feedback: I provided feedback on the design aspects of their projects, offering suggestions for improving the user experience and visual appeal. This collaboration helped both of us create more polished final products.

Project Updates

Original Plan: The original design was functional but lacked a modern and polished look.
Update: The frontend design was overhauled to incorporate a more modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface
Reasoning: User experience is critical for the success of the application. The initial design did not meet the standard for a contemporary application, so I decided to invest additional time in refining the UI/UX to make it more appealing and intuitive

Original Plan: The plan included integrating external APIs for payment processing, tax calculation, and currency conversion from the outset.
Update: The scope of API integration was reduced for the MVP. Only the essential APIs for payment processing were implemented, with plans to add tax and currency features in future iterations.
Reasoning: Integrating all planned APIs is proving to be more complex and time-consuming than initially anticipated. To ensure the project remains on schedule, Iwill focused on integrating the most critical API (payment processing) and deferred the others to a later stage.

PROGRESS

This week, Iâ€™d rate my progress at about a 7 out of 10. Iâ€™m keeping track by comparing what Iâ€™ve finished against the goals I set. Iâ€™ve made good headway, especially with the backend and getting the frontend design in place. However, I did hit a few snags while trying to integrate some features, which slowed things down a bit. Even with these challenges, Iâ€™m confident the project is still on schedule. Iâ€™ve adjusted the timeline slightly, but Iâ€™m making sure the most important parts will be completed as planned.

Progress

    Progress Rating: 7/10

    Explanation: This weekâ€™s progress has been steady, though some unforeseen challenges slowed things down. We successfully built the CRUD console for managing inventory in Python, and the back-end functionality with MySQL is working as expected. However, integrating the front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript took more time than initially planned. The dynamic features needed for real-time updates proved to be more complex than anticipated.

    Completed Parts: The backend for managing product inventory, including adding, updating, and deleting items in the database, is fully implemented. We also completed the initial design for the front-end user interface, focusing on the two core pages for inventory management and point-of-sale sales.

    Incomplete Aspects: Full front-end functionality, particularly the CRUD operations from the user interface, still needs to be completed and connected to the back-end API. Additionally, implementing real-time updates when products are sold and deducted from the inventory is still in progress.


Challenges

Technical Challenge: The most difficult technical challenge this week involved integrating the front-end interface with the back-end Python CRUD operations. The complexity arose when trying to ensure seamless data flow between the client-side JavaScript and the server-side Python code, especially when handling HTTP requests for creating, updating, and deleting items. The front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, uses JSON to send requests to the backend, which utilizes Flask to process these requests and interact with the MySQL database.

One specific hurdle was ensuring that the inventory data in MySQL stayed in sync with real-time updates on the front-end. As each transaction occurred, we needed to make sure the inventory was adjusted accordingly, but the asynchronous nature of JavaScript posed issues where the front-end didnâ€™t immediately reflect the backend changes. Debugging this took time, particularly in dealing with situations where the updates didnâ€™t persist properly in the database or werenâ€™t reflected quickly enough on the user interface. The issue was eventually mitigated by using AJAX for more responsive updates and tweaking the backend routes to handle multiple operations more efficiently.

Non-Technical Challenge: The most difficult non-technical challenge was time management and prioritizing tasks effectively. Initially, the project timeline seemed feasible, but the deeper we got into integration tasks, the more apparent it became that certain phases were under-budgeted in terms of time. For instance, designing the front-end while ensuring it not only looked modern but functioned in alignment with the backend proved to be more time-consuming than anticipated.

Additionally, communicating these changes to external stakeholdersâ€”like peers who provided feedbackâ€”took more effort. Managing these expectations without causing delays was a fine balance. Shifting priorities to tackle technical issues without losing sight of overall progress required frequent reassessment of timelines. To adapt, we had to revise the project milestones and ensure that the core functionalities for the MVP were prioritized over aesthetic or less critical features, a decision that had to be communicated clearly to everyone involved.
