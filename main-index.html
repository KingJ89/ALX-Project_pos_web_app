    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was inspired by the need to simplify business operations for small and medium-sized enterprises. Managing sales and inventory can be time-consuming and prone to error without an integrated system. This POS system was built to address those challenges, offering businesses a seamless and efficient way to manage their operations.</p>
        <p>Developed as part of my portfolio project for Holberton School,and as a dedication to my late mother who i lost this year in June, who cheered me on in everything i did and everything i was doing i became a software engineer to make yo proud mom, this project is dedicated to you, this POS system demonstrates my skills in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask. The project took approximately two months to complete, from initial research to final deployment.</p>
